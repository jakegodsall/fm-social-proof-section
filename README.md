## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   There was not any specific new features or techniques learned in this project. Rather, it was a greate opportunity to assimilate the things I have learned in previous projects.

### Continued development

-   I shall learn to reach the children of an element in SASS. The way I did so in this project was unwieldy and I believe there is a much better way of doing so.
